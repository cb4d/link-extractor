# link-extractor

Personal project replicating the [Application Containerization and Microservice Orchestration](https://training.play-with-docker.com/microservice-orchestration) tutorial from play-with-docker, but also building the [Link Extractor](https://github.com/ibnesayeed/linkextractor) application along the way to learn about kotlin web technologies like KTor and Vertx.

### Resources

I've copied the tutorial instructions into (here)[/docs/docker-microservice-guide.html] for easy reference.

### Tasks

1. Create a repo for the project and push to my personal github
2. Clone the python link extractor in a submodule for reference
3. Replicate the scraper script from step 0 using ktor
4. Install and configure docker locally, for use in the subsequent steps
5. Go through steps 1-5, using ktor instead of python along the way
6. Replace the scraper api service with one written in vertx
7. Complete step 6 of the tutorial, swapping out the api service
